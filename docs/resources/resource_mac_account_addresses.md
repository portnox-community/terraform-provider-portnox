# portnox_mac_account_addresses (Resource)

This resource manages multiple MAC addresses associated with a MAC-based account in Portnox.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "portnox_mac_account_addresses" "example123" {
  account_name = "test"

  mac_addresses {
      mac_address = "00:00:00:11:22:33"
      description = "printer1"
  }
  
  mac_addresses {
      mac_address = "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF"
      description = "securitycamera"
      expiration = "2025-12-31T23:59:59Z"
  }
  
  mac_addresses {
      mac_address = "11-22-33-44-55-66"
      description = "networkstorage" 
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `account_name` (String) The name of the MAC-based account.
- `mac_addresses` (Attributes List) A list of MAC addresses to be added. Each entry includes:
  - `mac_address` (String) The MAC address in standard format (e.g., 00:00:00:00:00:00 or 00-00-00-00-00-00). Must be properly formatted using standard MAC address notation.
  - `description` (String, Optional) A description of the MAC address. Limited to 64 alphanumeric characters only.
  - `expiration` (String, Optional) The expiration date/time of the MAC address.

## Import

MAC account addresses can be imported using the account name. There are two import formats available:

1. Import all MAC addresses associated with the account:
```bash
terraform import portnox_mac_account_addresses.example123 test
```

2. Import only specific MAC addresses by listing them after the account name:
```bash
terraform import portnox_mac_account_addresses.example123 "test,00:00:00:11:22:33;AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF"
```

When importing specific MAC addresses, separate multiple addresses with semicolons. This is useful when you want to manage only certain MAC addresses from a large account. If any specified MAC address doesn't exist in the account, the import will fail.

After import, update your Terraform configuration to include only the MAC addresses you want to manage. The resource will only manage MAC addresses that are explicitly declared in the configuration.

For example, after importing an account, you should update your configuration like this:

```terraform
resource "portnox_mac_account_addresses" "example123" {
  account_name = "test"

  # Only the MAC addresses declared here will be managed
  mac_addresses {
      mac_address = "00:00:00:11:22:33"
      description = "printer1"
  }
  
  # Other MAC addresses from the import will be ignored by Terraform
}
